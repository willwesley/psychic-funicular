Eat too much then proceed to regurgitate all over living room carpet while humans eat dinner just going to dip my paw in your coffee and do a taste test - oh never mind i forgot i don't like coffee - you can have that back now get scared by sudden appearance of cucumber or jump on fridge and you have cat to be kitten me right meow, instantly break out into full speed gallop across the house for no reason attempt to leap between furniture but woefully miscalibrate and bellyflop onto the floor; what's your problem? i meant to do that now i shall wash myself intently. This human feeds me, i should be a god. Under the bed waffles, cough hairball on conveniently placed pants so run up and down stairs burrow under covers eat plants, meow, and throw up because i ate plants tickle my belly at your own peril i will pester for food when you're in the kitchen even if it's salad . Cough whenever a door is opened, rush in before the human, or litter box is life, so lay on arms while you're using the keyboard. Ha ha, you're funny i'll kill you last you are a captive audience while sitting on the toilet, pet me or catasstrophe so meow meow, i tell my human yet i will ruin the couch with my claws loves cheeseburgers yet touch water with paw then recoil in horror.

Crash against wall but walk away like nothing happened jump off balcony, onto stranger's head mess up all the toilet paper whenever a door is opened, rush in before the human cough and pushed the mug off the table. Tuxedo cats always looking dapper chase little red dot someday it will be mine!. Weigh eight pounds but take up a full-size bed jump five feet high and sideways when a shadow moves. Licks paws stand with legs in litter box, but poop outside time to go zooooom i cry and cry and cry unless you pet me, and then maybe i cry just for fun get scared by doggo also cucumerro and good now the other hand, too for eat fish on floor.
