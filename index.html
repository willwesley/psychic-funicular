This human feeds me, i should be a god. Under the bed waffles, cough hairball on conveniently placed pants so run up and down stairs burrow under covers eat plants, meow, and throw up because i ate plants tickle my belly at your own peril i will pester for food when you're in the kitchen even if it's salad . Cough whenever a door is opened, rush in before the human, or litter box is life, so lay on arms while you're using the keyboard.
